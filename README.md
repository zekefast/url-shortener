# Task

A LITTLE CODING CHALLENGE FOR YOU

In this challenge, we're asking you to spice up your life with your very own
URL Shortener!

We've all seen sites like [bit.ly](https://bitly.com) that allow you to shorten
a URL into something... well... shorter!
It's time to make your own.

There are roughly four parts to this challenge:

1. Make a small API app that receives in a URL with a stack of your choice.
2. Using the supplied URL, generate a unique URL with the base of tier.app.
   It should be generated keeping uniqueness in mind.
3. Return the shortened URL.
4. Bonus: track the visits in a second DB table for stats.

It sounds more complex but breaking it down into these steps should help you
tackle the problem more effectively.
**Please do not spend more than 2 hours** on this, don’t worry if you
don’t finish everything.
Please, treat the code as if it is going into production.

Please send us a link to your project on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

Good luck and have fun!
